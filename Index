Project ended with the normal data output pc programming(2020-03-16)
-This project ended with the result of Joining kinect and serial data recognition.

-Needed to be approved :

Qbytearray should be firmly recognized other sources, in this case string data.

Kinect will be in the one of same Threading. In this case, i would be more appropriate to just using other process

in PC since python only gives you one threading data process ability.

Thanks,
